# Shopify Integration (Testing Required)

**Status**: 🚧 Not yet tested

This integration guide is planned but requires testing before documentation.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test on Shopify Basic plan
- [ ] Test on Shopify trial account
- [ ] Verify tracking on product pages
- [ ] Verify tracking on checkout pages
- [ ] Test with different themes
- [ ] Document theme.liquid modification process
- [ ] Test impact on page load speed

## Potential Integration Methods

1. **Edit theme.liquid file** (Direct code access)
2. **Theme Customizer → Additional Scripts** (if supported by theme)
3. **Shopify Script Editor** (Shopify Plus only)

## Known Considerations

- Checkout pages may have restrictions on custom scripts
- Some themes have built-in analytics sections
- Need to test with Shopify's own analytics
- E-commerce tracking may require additional setup
