# GoDaddy Website Builder Integration (Testing Required)

**Priority**: 🟡 MEDIUM (10% among website builders)
**Status**: 🚧 Not yet tested
**Market Data**: Popular with budget-conscious SMBs, first-time business owners

This integration guide is planned but requires testing before documentation. GoDaddy's affordable pricing ($9.99/mo intro) makes it popular with new businesses.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test with Basic plan ($9.99/mo intro, $12.99/mo regular)
- [ ] Test Settings → Advanced → HTML/Code injection
- [ ] Verify tracking with GoDaddy Website Builder (not WordPress hosting)
- [ ] Test with different GoDaddy templates
- [ ] Test with GoDaddy Online Store (e-commerce)
- [ ] Document any conflicts with GoDaddy's marketing tools
- [ ] Test with GoDaddy's InSight analytics
- [ ] Verify script loads after GoDaddy's page builder renders

## Potential Integration Methods

1. **Settings → Advanced → HTML Code** (If available)
2. **Section → Add Section → Custom Code** (In page builder)
3. **Footer Settings → Custom Code** (If supported by plan)

## Known Considerations

- GoDaddy Website Builder is different from GoDaddy WordPress hosting
- May have plan limitations on custom code (need to verify)
- GoDaddy has their own marketing suite (potential conflicts)
- Page builder may restrict where scripts can be placed
- Need to distinguish between:
  - GoDaddy Website Builder (drag-and-drop)
  - GoDaddy Managed WordPress
  - GoDaddy Website + Marketing

## Market Opportunity

GoDaddy targets price-sensitive, first-time business owners:
- Small local businesses (restaurants, retail)
- Budget-conscious entrepreneurs
- Businesses just starting paid advertising
- Users who want "all-in-one" solutions

These businesses are experimenting with ads and need fraud protection without high costs.
