# Webflow Integration (Testing Required)

**Priority**: ⚪ LOW (Professional/agency focus, not SMB target market)
**Status**: 🚧 Deferred - Testing after high-priority platforms

This integration guide is planned but requires testing before documentation.

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test with free Webflow account
- [ ] Test with paid site plan (Custom Code feature)
- [ ] Verify tracking works in preview mode
- [ ] Verify tracking works on published site
- [ ] Test with Webflow CMS collections
- [ ] Test with custom interactions/animations
- [ ] Document Custom Code settings location

## Potential Integration Methods

1. **Project Settings → Custom Code** (Site plan required)
2. **Embed Component** (limited, may not persist)
3. **Before </body> tag in Project Settings**

## Known Considerations

- Custom Code is only available on paid site plans ($14+/month)
- Free accounts cannot add custom scripts
- May need to handle Webflow's page transitions
