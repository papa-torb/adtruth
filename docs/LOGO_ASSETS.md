## Logo Source Files

The source logo files are located in the main project workspace:

  - `github_banner.PNG` - Full banner with text and tagline
  - `name_and_tag_line_crop.PNG` - Name and tagline variant

## Logo Usage Guidelines

### Current Design (Temporary)
The current logo features a detective beagle character with a targeting scope. This is a **temporary design** created for MVP launch.

### Brand Colors
- **Primary**: Green cap (#4A7C59)
- **Secondary**: Brown/tan beagle (#C4915A)
- **Accent**: Gray targeting scope
- **Background**: Cream/beige (#F5F5DC)

### Future Improvements
- Logo will be refined with professional designer input
- Consider simpler, more scalable icon for small sizes
- Potential vector (SVG) versions for web use
- High-resolution PNG exports for print materials

## Favicon Generation

Favicons are generated from `adtruth_big_logo_crop.PNG` using the `generate_favicons.py` script in the workspace root.

Sizes generated:
- 16x16px (favicon-16x16.png)
- 32x32px (favicon-32x32.png)
- 180x180px (apple-touch-icon.png)
- Multi-size ICO (favicon.ico)

## Notes

- All logo files should remain in version control
- Update this document when logo assets change
- Reference these assets in documentation until professional redesign

> **Note:** This project is still under development.
