## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

- `feat:` - A new feature
- `fix:` - A bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation only changes
- `style:` - Changes that don't affect code meaning
- `refactor:` - Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` - Performance improvement
- `test:` - Adding missing tests
- `chore:` - Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
```
feat: add browser fingerprinting support
fix: resolve memory leak in tracking function
docs: update API reference for init method
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript

- Use ES6+ features
- 2 spaces for indentation
- Use semicolons
- Use single quotes for strings
- Add JSDoc comments for functions

Example:
```javascript
/**
 * Initialize AdTruth tracking
 * @param {string} apiKey - The API key for authentication
 * @param {Object} options - Configuration options
 * @returns {void}
 */
function init(apiKey, options = {}) {
  // Implementation
}
```

### Testing

- Write unit tests for all new functions
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use descriptive test names

Example:
```javascript
describe('AdTruth.init()', () => {
  it('should initialize with valid API key', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });

  it('should throw error with invalid API key', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

## Documentation

- Update README.md if you change functionality
- Add JSDoc comments to all public APIs
- Include examples for new features
- Keep documentation concise and clear
